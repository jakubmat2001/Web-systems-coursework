A server-side-rendered website, optimized for searchability on the internet. The website allows employees to bet on projects that are to be undertaken in the future, where an employer/client will have the luxury of picking only those employees that are deemed best suited for the company's cost-to-work done ratio.

How To Run:

Pull the project from github
Open project in root directory
Switch to a "dockerized" branch with "git checkout dockerized" command
Using your console, move to backend root directory and type "docker-compose up --build"
Use another console to open the same project pulled from github at the root directory
type in "npm install" and after that type "npm start"
Voila ! All running as it should.
